### Project Title

Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description

In this project, we used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used

- .gitignore
- bikeshare.py
- README.md

### Credits

I would like to express my gratitude to Udacity and to the Bertelsman Scholarship Program that provided a opportunity to learn something and acquire new skills like writing queries in SQL, learned the basics of Python and related Pandas library and also about the version control in a GIT environment.
